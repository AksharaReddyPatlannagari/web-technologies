# web technologies
 
## Week 1: Install the following on the local machine
    Apache Web Server (if not installed)
    Tomcat Application Server locally
    Install MySQL (if not installed)
    Install PHP and configure it to work with Apache web server and MySQL
    (if not already configured)
## Week 2:
    a. Write an HTML page including JavaScript that takes a given set of integer
    numbers and shows them after sorting in descending order.
    b. Write an HTML page including any required JavaScript that takes a
    number from one text field in the range of 0 to 999 and shows it in
    another text field in words. If the number is out of range, it should
    show “out of range” and if it is not a number, it should show “not a
    number” message in the result box.
## Week 3:
    a. Write an HTML page that has one input, which can take multi-line text
    and a submit button. Once the user clicks the submit button, it should
    show the number of characters, words and lines in the text entered
    using an alert message. Words are separated with white space and lines
    are separated with new line character.
    b. Write an HTML page that contains a selection box with a list of 5
    countries. When the user selects a country, its capital should be printed
    next to the list. Add CSS to customize the properties of the font of the
    capital (color, bold and font size).
## Week 4 : 
    Create an XML document that contains 10 users information.
    Write a Java program, which takes User Id as input and returns the user
    details by taking the user information from the XML document using (a)
    DOM Parser and (b) SAX parser.
    Implement the following web applications using (a) PHP, (b) Servlets
    and (c) JSP:
## Week 5 :
    A user validation web application, where the user submits the
    login name and password to the server. The name and password are checked
    against the data already available in Database and if the data matches, a
    successful login page is returned. Otherwise a failure message is shown
    to the user.
## Week 6:
    a. Modify the above program to use an xml file instead of database
    b. Modify the above program to use AJAX to show the result on the same
    page below the submit button.
## Week 7 : 
    A simple calculator web application that takes two numbers and
    an operator (+, -, /, * and %) from an HTML page and returns the result
    page with the operation performed on the operands.
## Week 8 : 
    Modify the above program such that it stores each query in a
    database and checks the database first for the result. If the query is already
    available in the DB, it returns the value that was previously computed (from
    DB) or it computes the result and returns it after storing the new query
    and result in DB.
## Week 9 : 
    A web application takes a name as input and on submit it shows a
    hello <name> page where<name> is taken from the request. It shows the
    start time at the right top corner of the page and provides a logout button.
    On clicking this button, it should show a logout page with Thank You
    <name> message with the duration of usage (hint: Use session to store
    name and time).
## Week 10: 
    A web application that takes name and age from an HTML page.
    If the age is less than18, it should send a page with “Hello <name>, you
    are not authorized to visit this site” message, where <name> should be
    replaced with the entered name. Otherwise it should send “Welcome
    <name> to this site” message.
## Week 11: 
    A web application for implementation: The user is first
    served a login page which takes user’s name and password. After submitting
    the details, the server checks these values against the data from a database
    and takes the following decisions. If name and password matches, serves
    a welcome page with user’s full name. If name matches and password
    doesn’t match, then serves “password mismatch” page If name is not found
    in the database, serves a registration page, where user’s full name is asked
    and on submitting the full name, it stores, the login name, password and
    full name in the database (hint: use session for storing the submitted login
    name and password)
## Week 12 : 
    A web application that lists all cookies stored in the browser
    on clicking “List Cookies” button. Add cookies if necessary
